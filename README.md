## Running Storybook

From the command line in your generated app's root directory, enter `yarn run storybook`
This starts up the storybook server and opens a story navigator in your browser. With your app
running, choose Toggle Storybook from the developer menu to switch to Storybook; you can then
use the story navigator in your browser to change stories.

For Visual Studio Code users, there is a handy extension that makes it easy to load Storybook use cases into a running emulator via tapping on items in the editor sidebar. Install the `React Native Storybook` extension by `Orta`, hit `cmd + shift + P` and select "Reconnect Storybook to VSCode". Expand the STORYBOOK section in the sidebar to see all use cases for components that have `.story.tsx` files in their directories.
